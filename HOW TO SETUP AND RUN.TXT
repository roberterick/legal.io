This project uses Python 2.7 and Bottle

Bottle is the webserver and template renderer

To install Bottle, use pip:  pip install bottle

see http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html

The project uses modules which coordinate and have separate concerns. 

The controller module handles requests and performs lookups.

The model module handles data storage and provides data.

The templates and bottle provide "view" functionality, so the architecture is model-view-controller.
